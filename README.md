Haifisch
========

A very player-vs-player simple shooter.

It works only with gamepads so far, so you will need at least two gamepads.

See it running [here](https://xarvh.github.io/elm-haifisch/).


If your gamepads don't work, please [open an issue](https://github.com/xarvh/elm-haifisch/issues): make sure you note
your OS, browser, gamepad model and the [output from this test page](https://xarvh.github.io/elm-gamepad/).
Thanks <3



Goals
=====
* Make something that looks nice, it's fun, and it's simple
* Learn Svg and animations
* Find out a good API for a gamepads library
* Find out how far can I go with Elm before I yield to the urge of refactoring
