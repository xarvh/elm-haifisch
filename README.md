Haifisch
========

A very simple player-vs-player shooter.

It is multiplayer-only so far, so you will need at least a gamepad to shoot at something.

The gamepad remapping tool will remap only the first gamepad because I'm lazy, but hope
to fix it soon-ish.

See it running [here](https://xarvh.github.io/elm-haifisch/).


Goals
=====
* Experiment with making games in a purely functional language
* Experiment writing bots

TODO
====
* Computer-controlled opponents?
* Actual dynamics with acceleration and inertia rather than just a speed?
* Make the star and the planet actually do something?
* Multiplayer via websockets + server
